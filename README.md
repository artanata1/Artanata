# How AI powered Chatbot can solve Accounting and Finance Efficiency (Artanata)
Project Capstone Bangkit 2021

### Executive Summary: 
There are around 63 million MSMEs in Indonesia, 95% of which are still in the micro business sector. Many MSME actors do not understand the appropriate accounting reporting standards (SAK ETAP). We hope that we can help MSME players overcome financial reporting problems by presenting a chatbot feature in the application. The question is what is the level of penetration of Chatbot AI technology in MSME accounting records, how changes in attitudes and perceptions of existing business owners towards Chatbot technology in MSMEs and what are the challenges and opportunities for MSMEs to apply artificial intelligence technology solutions to their financial report recording. 

### Project Scope & Deliverables: 
- ðŸ”­ Product Scope
This project is the creation of a chatbot platform that implements it to have accounting records and financial reports on MSMEs. 
- ðŸŒ± Project Constraint
The project period is approximately 1 month, starting from May 3 to June 25.
Maximize existing project team resources, so that it does not require outsourcing.
User trials for this application are available at MSMEs in East Java
- âš¡ Product Requirements and Characteristics
Chatbot platforms with Artificial Intelligence require requirements that need to be considered, namely:
Build a chatbot platform that conforms to the Financial Accounting Standards for Entities without Public Accountability (SAK-ETAP)
This chatbot API implements NLP as an artificial intelligence that connects computer interactions and human language
- ðŸ‘¯ Deliverables
Deliverables that will be submitted to stakeholders are:
   1. Document Project Charter as a formal agreement between project stakeholders and project developers
   2. Document analysis of functional and non-functional requirements of Artificial Intelligence chatbots in recording financial reports.
   3. AI chatbot user statistics report
   4. Final Report
   5. The final product is a chatbot application with NLP (Natural Language Processing)

### Project Resources: 
- Roles and responsibilities 
  MD : create a mobile app so that it can be linked to the API 
  CC : Creating website interfaces, building training infrastructure, creating NLP and NLU APIs. 
  ML : Manage financial reporting automation with Classification algorithm type in Supervised Learning.
